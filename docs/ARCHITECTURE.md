#### Api::V1::DocsController
`GET /api/v1/openapi.json` — serves `docs/openapi.yaml` as JSON. Deliberately unauthenticated (inherits `ActionController::API` directly, not `BaseController`): describes the contract, exposes no data. Cached in-process; 1-hour public Cache-Control.

```

### Social Media Account Status Transitions

```
not_started (initial)
    ↓
entered (researcher found account)
    ↓
verified (verifier approved)
    ↓
[if verified] → enqueue_to_junkipedia_on_verification
    ↓
junkipedia_channel_id resolved
    ↓
added to JUNKIPEDIA_DEFAULT_LIST

Alternate flows:
- not_found (researcher couldn't find account)
- revised (verifier updated data)
- rejected (verifier rejected)
```

## Deployment & Environment

**Development:**
- Local PostgreSQL
- Email via Letter Opener gem (browser preview)
- Active Storage: local file storage

**Production (Heroku):**
- PostgreSQL 17 (Heroku Standard-0)
- Email: SMTP (configured via env vars)
- Active Storage: S3 (Bucketeer add-on)
- Background jobs: async in-memory (loses jobs on restart)

**Environment Variables:**
```
# Auth
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_CLIENT_ID, MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_CLIENT_SECRET

# Data Import
AIRTABLE_API_KEY, AIRTABLE_BASE_ID

# Junkipedia Integration
JUNKIPEDIA_API_TOKEN, JUNKIPEDIA_DEFAULT_LIST_ID

# Email
DEVISE_MAILER_FROM
SMTP_ADDRESS, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_USERNAME, SMTP_PASSWORD

# S3 (Production)
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_REGION, AWS_BUCKET
```

## Key Design Patterns

**1. Role-Based Access Control**
- Admin: `/admin/*` — full CRUD
- Researcher: `/researcher/*` — data entry
- Verifier: `/verification/*` — review
- Public: `/` — browsing only

**2. Assignment Workflow**
- Admin creates Assignment (person → researcher)
- Researcher works on assignment (enter data)
- Verifier reviews researcher's work
- If needed, secondary verification via separate assignment

**3. Async Junkipedia Sync**
- Verified account → enqueue job
- Job resolves channel ID
- Job adds to list
- Hand-off to Junkipedia for monitoring

**4. Data Import Pattern**
- Stage data to temp tables
- Analyze and validate
- Import to production with find_or_create_by (idempotent)

**5. Audit Trail**
- PaperTrail versions on all core models
- User tracking (entered_by, verified_by)
- Timestamps (entered_at, verified_at)
